				<h1>Welcome to my world !</h1>
				<img src="images/profile picture.jpg" alt="Emilie Valent" class="img-circle">
				<p>I am Emilie, I am 20 years old and I am a third year student at IESEG. This page will be a dive into my life, which will let you know more about me and my passions. Enjoy !</p>

				<h2>Music</h2>
				<p>I come from a family of musicians and music is one of the most important things in my life. I sing, I play the piano, and I am learning to play the guitar and drums. I can't spend a day without listening to music which I am doing right now while writing this paragraph !</p>

				<h2>Sports</h2>
				<p>Sport is my second passion. I did countless sports throughout my life: dance, gymnastic, ice skating, circus, ski, horse riding, tennis etc. But what thrills me today is tennis and horse riding. I love learning as much as playing/riding with friends, and of course, the competition !!</p>

				<h2>Travels</h2>
				<p>Travelling is my third and last passion. Since I was a little girl, I have been used to travelling to all sorts of places in the world: big cities, jungle, forest, desert, beach etc. I have been in all the 5 continents of the world and I wish to travel again and again to discover new countries and cultures. Even in my studies I managed to include this part of me by leaving for a semester of exchange in Bangkok, in Thailand where I had the opportunity to see countless of amazing landscapes and to meet incredible people.</p>
